        <h2>What Is Spaghetti alla Carbonara?</h2>
        <p>Carbonara is a Roman dish made with eggs,
         hard cheese, and cured pork. Its signature rich 
         and silky sauce comes from beaten eggs tossed 
         with hot pasta. The trick to making carbonara is 
         making sure the pasta is hot enough to cook the 
         eggs, but not so hot that they curdle. </p>
