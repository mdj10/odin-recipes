        <h2>What Is Spaghetti alla Carbonara?</h2>
        <p>Carbonara is a Roman dish made with eggs,
         hard cheese, and cured pork. Its signature rich 
         and silky sauce comes from beaten eggs tossed 
         with hot pasta. The trick to making carbonara is 
         making sure the pasta is hot enough to cook the 
         eggs, but not so hot that they curdle.</p>


        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 pound guanciale (cured pork cheek), 
            diced</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>10 tablesppons grated pecorino Romano
            cheese, divided</li>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
            to taste</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over 
            medium heat; add guanciale (see Cook's Note). 
            Cook, turning occasionally, until evenly 
            browned and crispy, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove 
            from heat and drain on paper towels.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a 
            boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, 
            stirring occasionally until tender yet firm 
            to the bite, about 9 minutes. Drain and return 
            to the pot. Let cool, stirring occasionally, 
            about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Whisk eggs, 1/2 of the Pecorino Romano 
            cheese, and some black pepper in a bowl until 
            smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>Pour egg mixture over pasta, stirring 
            quickly, until creamy and slightly cooled. 
            Stir in guanciale.</li>
            <li>Top with remaining Pecorino Romano 
            cheese and more black pepper.</li>
        </ol>
