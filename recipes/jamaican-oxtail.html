            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place oxtail in a shallow dish. 
            Combine soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, 
            salt, sugar, garlic and herb seasoning, 
            browning sauce, paprika, cayenne pepper, 
            and black pepper together in a small bowl. 
            Rub both sides of oxtail with soy sauce 
            mixture; discard any excess.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large, deep 
            skillet over medium-high heat. Sear oxtail 
            in hot oil until golden brown, about 3 
            minutes per side; transfer to a plate and 
            set aside.</li>
            <li>Saut√© carrots, celery, onion, and garlic 
            in the same skillet until softened, about 
            5 minutes. Add beef broth, thyme, rosemary, 
            and bay leaf; bring to a boil. Add oxtail, 
            with its juices, and butter. Reduce heat to 
            low, cover, and simmer until oxtail is fork 
            tender, about 3 hours.</li>
            <li>Uncover skillet and increase heat to 
            high. Cook, stirring occasionally, until 
            sauce reduces and thickens, about 
            5 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
